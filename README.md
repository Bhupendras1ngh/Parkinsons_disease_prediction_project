# Parkinsons_disease_prediction_project with accuracy = 93.3%
I have completed this project with 93.3% accuracy , in which we have predict Parkinson  disease on the behalf of certain parameters or features 
Using different algorithms like Logistic regression , SVM , K-Neighbors , XGBoost  , get different accuracies with different algorith , highest accuracy is obtained by XG-BOOST
